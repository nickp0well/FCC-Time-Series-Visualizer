# FCC-Time-Series-Visualizer
In this repository, as a part of freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python course, I visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
